# Architecture & Implementation Book for the Integration of MÜSLI into MaMpf

This book documents the architecture, user-facing features, and implementation plan for the integration of MÜSLI features into MaMpf. It is organized into three main parts:

1. **Core Architecture:** Documents the backend services, data models, and workflows. This includes:
    - Registration workflows (campaigns, policies, allocation)
    - Preference-based assignment strategy
    - Post-allocation administration patterns
    - Assessments, grading, and eligibility computation
    - The end-to-end lifecycle from enrollment to grading

2. **User-Facing Applications:** Describes the dashboards and interfaces for students and staff that consume the core architecture.

3. **Project Planning:** Outlines the high-level implementation plan and migration strategy for integrating these new features into the existing platform.
