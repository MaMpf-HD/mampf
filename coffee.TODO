# This file was originally generated via the following command:
# find . -type f -name '*.coffee' ! -path './node_modules/*' | xargs wc -l | sort -n

### Usage
# See https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate
# Use npm install -g decaffeinate
# Use decaffeinate app/views/whatever.coffee
#
# You might also want to use the REPL since -ERB syntax is not supported
# (and with the REPL, you can paste in parts of the file as well).
# https://decaffeinate-project.org/repl/

### Watch out for
- Don't forget to change .js to .js.erb if needed. But use the pure 
  .js whenever possible, i.e. when no ERB syntax is used.
- Strings inside Strings, e.g. this:
    .append('<%= j render partial: "quiz_certificates/form" %>')
 should be converted to
    .append("<%= j render partial: 'quiz_certificates/form' %>");
 Watch out for this since ESLint won't see ERB syntax and thus replace the outer
 ' quotes with ", but this leads to errors, so you have to replace the inner
 " quotes with ' manually. You should be warned by the weird syntax highlights
 in the editor though.
- When testing changes, note that jquery .data() does not modify the HTML attribute
  and instead stores it inside some internal $.cache. Just to avoid confusion...

### üåü DONE
- "D" as first character in the line means that the file has been deleted
  entirely because it was not needed anymore.
- The number indicates the number of lines in that file minus 1.
- Everywhere where I don't specify something in parentheses, I've manually checked
  that the new new .js or .js.erb file is called (via console.log) and that it works.
- Double-check files marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è

D3 ./app/views/lectures/render_sidebar.coffee (not actually used anymore:
    the sidebar is rendered directly in application.html.erb. Furthermore it
    doesn't use @course any where in _sidebar.html.erb and the coffee file
    was added 6 years ago, that's why I think it's safe to delete it. The sidebar
    renders correctly without it.)

D4 ./app/assets/javascripts/file_upload.coffee (‚ùó‚ö†Ô∏è I think this one can be deleted.
At least I've searched for "custom-file-input" and "custom-file-label" and only
found the coffee file itself. There is also no route called file_upload, fileUpload,
or anything related and the code was added 6 years ago and then not modified, see
https://github.com/MaMpf-HD/mampf/commit/37ce5f7988fa40c2de59e6bdfb0972cea81673df.
Note that the respective "//= require file_upload" was added 5 years ago via
https://github.com/MaMpf-HD/mampf/commit/f752f6297b9d290cbd5f33eeaf5e1d716eb80384).
