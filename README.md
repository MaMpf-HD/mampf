# README

This is supposed to become an API for the MaMpf project.
As of now, only the models and some class methods have been implemented, together with a rake task that imports data from csv files.
Just play around with it to get a feeling...

* Ruby version: 2.4.0
* Rails Version: 5.1.1

* Database initialization: 
    rails setup:import_data
  
  This imports a lot of data form the .csv files in the db/csv folder

* How to run the test suite: rspec
