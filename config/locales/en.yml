# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

          Normally this should be the person that actually gives the lecture.
          If this person does not want to upload materials himself or
          herself, this can be realized by additional lecture editors.
        workflow: >
          In the following we describe one possible workflow.
          The workflow depends on whether the lecture is
          <i>video based</i> oder <i>script based</i>.
          <ul>
          <li>
          <i>
          video based:
          </i>
          Create chapters and sections and tag these. Afterwards,
          create sessions and related media - they will inherit the tags.
          Of course it is possible the other way around as well,
          but then you will not have the benefits of inheritance of tags.
          </li>
          <li>
          <i>
          script based:
          </i>
          It is recommended to include the
          <a href='/mampf.sty' download='mampf.sty'>MaMpf-Package</a>
          into the manuscript's .tex-file and to provide anything
          that is labelled with \mampflabels.
          When the resulting script is uploaded to MaMpf, it is possible to
          import the structure of the manuscript to MaMpf as well, so that
          chapters and sections are automatically created in MaMpf.
          Additionally, MaMpf can automatically create corresponding tags.
          After the script has been uploaded and its structure imported to
          MaMpf, you can create sessions. For these you can choose
          the content from the script's structure.
          </li>
          </ul>
          You can try to combine both variants. If you have a video based
          lecture, you can of upload a manuscript as well and import its
          structure, if the manuscript uses MaMpf's LaTEX package.
        variants: >
          Here you can set how MaMpf gets the detailed contents of sections
          and sessions. This is irrelevant if you do not want to supply
          MaMpf with detailed content.
          <ul>
          <li>
          <i>
          video based:
          </i>
          MaMpf uses all items that have been created in the THymE video editor
          for the corresponding sections and for videos that are associated to
          the corresponding sessions. They are sorted by the time they appear
          in the video.
          </li>
          <li>
          <i>
          script based:
          </i>
          MaMpf uses all items in that section that have been provided with a
          MaMpf label in the LATEX file of the manuscript
          and those that have been chosen during the editing of the session.
          In order for that to work, MaMpf labels have to created in the
          script's LaTEX file using the
          <a href='/mampf.sty' download='mampf.sty'>MaMpf-Package</a>
          and have to be imported to MaMpf after the uploading of the script.
          </li>
          </ul>
