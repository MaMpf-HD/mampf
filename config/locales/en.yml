# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

          Normally this should be the person that actually gives the event series.
          If this person does not want to upload materials himself or
          herself, additional event series editors can do this instead.
        workflow: >
          This is a possible workflow.
          The workflow depends on whether the event series is
          <i>video based</i> oder <i>script based</i>.
          <ul>
          <li>
          <i>
          media based (default):
          </i>
          Create chapters and sections and tag them. Afterwards,
          create sessions and related media - they will inherit the tags.
          You can also start with creating sessions and related media if you like.
          In this case, you will not benefit from inheritance of tags.
          </li>
          <li>
          <i>
          script based:
          </i>
          It is necessary to include the
          <a href='/mampf.sty' download='mampf.sty'>MaMpf-Package</a>
          into the manuscript's .tex-file and to provide anything
          that is labelled with \mampflabels.
          When you upload the resulting script to MaMpf, you can import the
          structure of the manuscript to MaMpf as well. MaMpf will then automatically
          create chapters and sections.
          Additionally, MaMpf can automatically create corresponding tags.
          After the script has been uploaded and its structure imported to
          MaMpf, you can create sessions. For these you can select
          the content from the script's structure.
          </li>
          </ul>
          You can try to combine both variants. Video based event series can
          have scripts too. You may upload a manuscript and import its structure,
          if the manuscript uses MaMpf's LaTeX package.
        variants: >
          Here you can set how MaMpf extracts content information for sections
          and sessions. This is irrelevant if you do not want to supply
          MaMpf with detailed content information.
          <ul>
          <li>
          <i>
          media based (default):
          </i>
          MaMpf uses all items created in the THymE video editor for the
          corresponding sections and for videos associated with the corresponding
          sessions. They are sorted by the time they appear in the video.
          </li>
          <li>
          <i>
          using a manuscript generated by the MaMpf LaTeX package:
          </i>
          MaMpf uses all items in this section with a MaMpf label in the LaTeX
          file of the manuscript and all items selected in the editing process
          of the session. For this to work, you need to create MaMpf labels in
          the script's LaTeX file using the
          <a href='/mampf.sty' download='mampf.sty'>MaMpf-Package</a>
          and import them to MaMpf after uploading the script.
          </li>
          </ul>
        orphaned_lessons: >
          Orphaned sessions are sessions that do not belong to any section.
          They can emerge if you delete a section that had sessions in it.

          This is the list of all media associated with this event series
          or its sessions. Media in red are not yet published or locked.

          series, you are informed about them.

          These are the tags associated with the parent course that appear in at
          least one section of this event series.

          These are the tags that appear in at least one section of this
          event series, but are not associated with the parent course.
        untreated_tags: >
          These are the tags associated with the parent course that do
          not appear in any section of this event series.
        course_editors: >
          Course editors have editing access to the parent course. They inherit
          editing access to any event series that belongs to this course.

          If the first chapter (or talk) is supposed to have a number different from "1",
          you can enter this number here. E.g., this may apply to event series
          where chapter/talk numbering is continued over successive terms as it
          is sometimes done in successive event series.
        first_section: >
          If absolute numbering is activated for sections, you can enter
          the number of the first section here.
        absolute_numbering: >
          By default, the numbering for sections is relative to the chapter.
          E.g., the third section in chapter 4 is §4.3. If you deactivate this
          behaviour, sections will be counted across chapter borders.
        passphrase: >
          If you enter something here, users can subscribe to this event series only
          upon entering this passphrase. Media associated to this event series or
          any of its sessions are then invisible for users who have not

          This is the list of course editors. They can edit the course,

          This is relevant because users can adjust their settings so
          that they are shown related materials form preceding courses.

        start_time: >
          Here you can enter the time when the item starts in the video.
          If you clicked the 'Add Item' button at the correct position in the
          video, the correct time should already be displayed here.
          Alternatively, you can grab the time corresponding to the current
          position in the video by clicking the 'Take current time' button,
          or you may enter the time manually.
        type: >
          Here you can select which kind of item it is (Theorem, Remark,
          Lemma etc.). If none of the selections match it is recommended
          that you select 'Mark' and provide details in the description.
        section: >
          Here you can select to which section the item belongs. You have
          two choices:

          <li>
          If the medium is associated to an event series or a session, you can
          select one of the sections associated to this event series or session.
          This is primarily designed for session videos.
          </li>
          <li>
          You do not want to associate a section form the database.
          That is fine as well.
          </li>
          </ul>
        number: >
          Here you can enter the number of the item in your preferred kind
          of numbering, e.g. '7.4' or '7.1.3'.

      Your input has been interpreted in a way you did not expect?
      This may be due to one of the following reasons:
      <ul>
      <li>
      For polynomials in sveral variables you should pay attention to put
      a '*' between variables if they are to be multiplied. E.g., the expression
      "xy" would be interpreted as one Variable with the name xy, not as "x*y"
      (which you would have to write in this way). For multiplication with
      scalars, a "*" is unneccessary: 3x will be automatically interpreted as
      3*x
      </li>
      <li>
      Commas are not admissible for expressing decimals; the fraction 3/2
      (which would be recognized by MaMpf, by the way) would have to be written
      as 1.5 as a decimal.
      </li>
      <li>
      Commas are not - as is common in English - admissible for separation
      of thousands: The number three thousand has to be written as 3000, not as
      3,000.
