# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

          If this person does not want to upload materials himself or
          herself, additional event series editors can do this instead.
        workflow: >
          These are possible workflows.
          The workflow depends on whether the event series is
          <i>video based</i> oder <i>script based</i>.
          <ul>
          <li>
          <i>
          media based (default):
          </i>
          Possibility 1: Create chapters and sections and tag them.
          Afterwards, create sessions and related media - they will
          inherit the tags.
          Possibility 2: Create chapters and sections. Afterwards, create
          sessions and create media within the sessions. Tag these media,
          and lessons and section will inherit the corresponding tags.
          </li>
          <li>
          <i>
          script based:
          </i>
          It is necessary to include the
          <a href='/mampf.sty' download='mampf.sty'>MaMpf-Package</a>
          into the manuscript's .tex-file and to provide anything
          that is labelled with \mampflabels.
          When you upload the resulting script to MaMpf, you can import the
          structure of the manuscript to MaMpf as well. MaMpf will then automatically
          create chapters and sections.
          Additionally, MaMpf can automatically create corresponding tags.
          After the script has been uploaded and its structure imported to
          MaMpf, you can create sessions. For these you can select
          the content from the script's structure.
          </li>
          </ul>
          You can try to combine both variants. Video based event series can
          have scripts too. You may upload a manuscript and import its structure,
          if the manuscript uses MaMpf's LaTeX package.
        variants: >
          Here you can set how MaMpf extracts content information for sections
          and sessions. This is irrelevant if you do not want to supply
          MaMpf with detailed content information.
          <ul>
          <li>
          <i>
          media based (default):
          </i>
          MaMpf uses all items created in the THymE video editor for the
          corresponding sections and for videos associated with the corresponding
          sessions. They are sorted by the time they appear in the video.
          </li>
          <li>
          <i>
          using a manuscript generated by the MaMpf LaTeX package:
          </i>
          MaMpf uses all items in this section with a MaMpf label in the LaTeX
          file of the manuscript and all items selected in the editing process
          of the session. For this to work, you need to create MaMpf labels in
          the script's LaTeX file using the
          <a href='/mampf.sty' download='mampf.sty'>MaMpf-Package</a>
          and import them to MaMpf after uploading the script.
          </li>
          </ul>
        orphaned_lessons: >

          series, you are informed about them.

          least one section of this event series.
        additional_tags: >

    about: >
      MaMpf is a constantly growing project offering various
      e-learning services. MaMpf's tagging system helps you find
      all existing media to a keyword quickly and easily.
      In addition, MaMpf links keywords and visualizes their relations
      in Mind maps. In MaMpf you have the following at your disposal:
    kaviar_html:
      '<strong>
        Hypervideos:
      </strong>
      Lecture recordings, worked examples and repetition videos with
      content structure and links to related materials'
    sesam_html:
      '<strong>
        Hypertexts:
      </strong>
      Lecture notes, exercise sheets and additional materials with links and outlines
      that can be searched in MaMpf'
    keks_html:
      '<strong>
        Quizzes:

      compiled from a large collection of multiple choice questions and calculation tasks, and
      guided proofs'

      Your input has been interpreted in a way you did not expect?
      This may be due to one of the following reasons:
      <ul>
      <li>
      Polynomials in several variables behave differently.  You need to put a '*'
      between variables if you want them to be multiplied. E.g., the expression
      "xy" is interpreted as a Variable called xy, not as "x*y"
      (which is what you want to use). For multiplication with
      scalars, a "*" is unneccessary: 3x will be automatically interpreted as
      3*x
      </li>
      <li>
      Commas are not admissible for expressing decimals; the fraction 3/2
      (which would be recognized by MaMpf, by the way) would have to be written
      as 1.5 as a decimal.
      </li>
      <li>
      Commas are not - as is common in English - admissible for separation
      of thousands: The number three thousand has to be written as 3000, not as
      3,000.
