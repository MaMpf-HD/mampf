# Security Policy

> [!warning]
> MaMpf is continuously deployed, so users will always get to work with the newest version.<br>That's why we will only release patches for the `main` branch.

- We are very grateful for any reports of security vulnerabilities in MaMpf. We take security very seriously and will respond to verified reports as soon as possible.
- Please don't report vulnerabilities in the public GitHub issue tracker. Instead, [**report them here privately on GitHub**](https://github.com/MaMpf-HD/mampf/security/advisories) and do NOT disclose them publicly until we have had a chance to address them.
- Note that we don't give out bounties for security vulnerabilities. We are a non-profit project and don't have the resources to pay for security reports. We are grateful for any reports and will acknowledge them in our release notes.
