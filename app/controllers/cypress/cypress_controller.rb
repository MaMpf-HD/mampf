module Cypress
  # Handles Cypress requests for interactive UI testing.
  #
  # The main purpose of this class is to send back errors as JSON object
  # to parse them in the Cypress test UI. This way, we can display the error
  # message and the stacktrace in the Cypress test.
  #
  # The convention with the frontend is to return the status `created`
  # for successful requests and `bad_request` (or anything else) for failed requests.
